**TECHNOLOGIES, LIBRARIES, APIs**

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

  - Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
  - The MapBox API to render a mini-map that will display nearby restaurants with the same provided name 
  - The GeoLocation API to fetch the users current location => in order to fetch the nearest restaurant locations as well as the relative distances of other restaurants


**IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**

      Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Create repo, learn how to use and fetch from the Yelp API, MapBox API as well as the Geolocation API. 

      Monday: On this day, I should be working on implementing logic to fetch from the APIs.

      Tuesday: I will make sure the map is rendered correctly, and layout is interactive.

      Wednesday: Focus on styling, as well as implementing color schemes and nav links. 

      Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
